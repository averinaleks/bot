          # names that end with ".py" therefore look like legitimate modules to
          # the extractor, even though the files are plaintext Git logs. When a
          # workflow fetches the entire history (fetch-depth: 0), those logs are
          # recreated and CodeQL tries to parse them, triggering hundreds of
          # syntax errors. Rather than deleting the entire .git directory (which
          # we might want for other tooling), remove only the misleading *.py
          # files from any Git log directories that exist in the workspace.
