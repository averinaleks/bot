          # Remove the primary repository metadata directory as well as any
          # nested ones that may exist after checkout. CodeQL treats any file
          # ending in .py as Python source, and Git reference logs for remote
          # branches can therefore surface as false positives. A simple rm -rf
          # is more reliable than a complex find expression and avoids
          # corner-case syntax issues that previously left the directories in
          # place.
