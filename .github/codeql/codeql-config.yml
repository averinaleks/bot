  # Ignore Git metadata everywhere in the checkout so that CodeQL never walks
  # into reference logs for remote branches that happen to end with the .py
  # suffix. Those logs are plain text, but the extractor interprets the file
  # extension literally and attempts to parse them as Python modules, which
  # surfaces hundreds of misleading syntax errors. Explicitly excluding all
  # .git directories (and everything under them) keeps the analysis focused on
  # real source files while remaining resilient to future branch names.
