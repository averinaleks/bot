  # Ensure Git metadata created during checkout (including reference logs) is never
  # analysed by CodeQL. CodeQL interprets any *.py file it discovers as Python
  # source, so logs for remote refs with names that end in ".py" must be
  # excluded explicitly. We therefore ignore every possible .git directory or
  # file pattern, regardless of depth or naming, to avoid future false parse
  # errors when CodeQL walks the workspace.
