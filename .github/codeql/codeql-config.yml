  # Ensure Git metadata created during checkout (including reference logs) is never
  # analysed by CodeQL. CodeQL interprets any *.py file it discovers as Python
  # source, so logs for remote refs with names that end in ".py" must be
  # excluded explicitly. We therefore ignore .git directories (and everything
  # beneath them) no matter where they appear in the workspace tree to avoid
  # future false parse errors when CodeQL walks the workspace.
