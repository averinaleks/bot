# Optional heavy dependencies
# Pin OpenCV to a release that still supports NumPy<2.0 so that it remains
# compatible with the pandas version used in CI (pandas 2.1.x only ships
# wheels built against NumPy 1.26). Newer OpenCV wheels force an upgrade to
# NumPy>=2, which breaks binary compatibility on Python 3.10 during the test
# workflow.
