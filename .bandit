# Exclude directories that intentionally contain test helpers or scripts
# using plain ``assert`` statements or other patterns Bandit would normally
# flag. Bandit's ``exclude`` option relies on fnmatch semantics, so we use
# glob patterns that explicitly match paths rooted at the repository base as
# well as any subdirectories.
